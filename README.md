# CSC212-Final-Project
My final project for CSC212 at the University of Rhode Island in the fall of 2014.

Introduction:

This is my final project for CSC212: Data Structures from URI.  Writing this explanation a year after the fact, I no longer have the exact assignment, but I believe we had to create a program that created a data structure and utilized objects.  I created a simple simulation of plugging appliances into a power strip at a food booth.  The appliances vary in their amps used, expected returns, and the size of the plugs.  The program will attempt to automatically sort the large plugs so that they are plugged in at the end.  Appliances can be removed by getting rid of the low performers: either the appliance which uses the highest amps, or brings in the lowest amount of money.

More information can be found in the 'Final Project User Manual' file.  A list of method headers and explanations can be found in the "Final Tech Doc" file.  Both of these were part of the original submission to my professor.

This project was still pretty early in my education, but I am still fairly pleased with it.
